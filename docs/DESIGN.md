# Game Design Document

## Overview

'Break this Game' is a unique gaming experience that challenges players to exploit the game mechanics to succeed. The objective is to "break" the game through hacking, cheating, and creative problem-solving.

## Goals

- Provide an engaging and educational experience that teaches players about coding and hacking techniques.
- Encourage creativity and critical thinking as players explore game mechanics.
- Create a community-driven project where players can share their exploits and hacks.

## Game Mechanics

1. **Hacking and Cheating**: Players must use hacking techniques to modify game behavior, access hidden features, or overcome obstacles.
2. **Exploitable Mechanics**: Certain game elements will be intentionally designed to be broken or bypassed, creating opportunities for players to exploit them.
3. **Feedback Loop**: The game will provide feedback on the effectiveness of player exploits, encouraging experimentation.

## Planned Features

- **Dynamic Levels**: Levels that change based on player actions, creating unique challenges each playthrough.
- **Mod Support**: Allow players to create and share their own modifications and hacks for the game.
- **Educational Content**: Include tutorials and guides on basic coding and hacking concepts integrated into gameplay.

## Breaking Mechanics

- **Glitching Through Walls**: Players can find and exploit bugs to pass through barriers that would otherwise be impassable.
- **Memory Editing**: Certain challenges may involve editing game memory or variables to achieve unexpected results.
- **Exploiting AI Behaviors**: Players can manipulate NPC behaviors through unconventional means, such as causing them to get stuck or act erratically.
